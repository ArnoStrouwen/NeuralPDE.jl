# NeuralPDE.jl: Scientific Machine Learning for Partial Differential Equations

[NeuralPDE.jl](https://github.com/SciML/NeuralPDE.jl)
NeuralPDE.jl is a solver package which consists of neural network solvers for
partial differential equations using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). This package utilizes
neural stochastic differential equations to solve PDEs at a greatly increased generality 
compared with classical methods.

## Features

- Physics-Informed Neural Networks for automated PDE solving
- Deep-learning-based solvers for optimal stopping time and Kolmogorov backwards equations
