# NeuralPDE.jl: Scientific Machine Learning for Partial Differential Equations

[NeuralPDE.jl](https://github.com/SciML/NeuralPDE.jl)
NeuralPDE.jl is a solver package which consists of neural network solvers for
partial differential equations using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).

## Features

- Physics-Informed Neural Networks for ODE, SDE, RODE, and PDE solving
- Ability to define extra loss functions to mix xDE solving with data fitting (scientific machine learning)
- Automated construction of Physics-Informed loss functions from a high level symbolic interface
- Sophisticated techniques like quadrature training strategies, adaptive loss functions, and neural adapters
  to accelerate training
- Integrated logging suite for handling connections to TensorBoard
- Handling of (partial) integro-differential equations and various stochastic equations
- Specialized forms for solving `ODEProblem`s with neural networks
